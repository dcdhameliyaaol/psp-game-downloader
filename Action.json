A series of connected balls will slowly move across the screen in a set pattern. As they slowly move across the screen towards a pyramid on the other side of the screen, you will be provided with a paddle along the bottom to fight. The balls have different colours will appear on the oars, and you will “shoot” them on top of the ball moving across the screen. The only way to win the game is to match three or more balls of the same colour, by shooting one ball at two or more of the same colour. Do this many times you will clear a string of balls. But that is not enough. The game also requires you to have “quick hand and eye”, otherwise the ball will quickly fill out the screen. In addition, you have to perform all the shots a few times before you can fill the progress bar below the paddle. When the bar is full, it will be considered to complete the stage and get a reward based on the level. Points that you can fight. It can be said that this is a basic game like any other puzzle game but Luxor – Pharaoh’s Challenge is more attractive by 2D images, quite beautiful context, attractive levels and relatively low price.",

But Lulu’s body doesn’t have the “attributes” that magic users must have. So if they leave, not accepting her will seriously damage her magic. Therefore, during their time at Mirus Clare, if Lulu can’t find her attribute, they have no choice but to seal their magical ability. So your main goal in the game is to meet and win the hearts of one of the six male students in the school because each one has a different attribute, which will give you the strongest attributes. The game is a complete story that brings all the cute and funny elements, especially the magic scenes in school, or the lovely scenes in the segment to get to know and approach beautiful male students… The characters built by the manufacturer are also very cute, cute and funny, they all have unique personalities, Lulu is resilient, heroes, Noel is cute, warm.",
